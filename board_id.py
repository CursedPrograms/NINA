"""
Finds which serial port an Arduino is on by asking it who it is, so DREAM and
ARM can run from the same PC without hard-coding COM ports.

    PC:   WHO
    COM6: I am Arm      (or "I am Dream", "I am Nina")

The sketches (arm.ino, dream_sensors.ino, NINA's ir_reader.ino) answer "WHO" with
that line. This file is kept identical in the DREAM, ARM-Robot-v01 and NINA repos.
